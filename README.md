# C++ Route Planning Project 



This project implements a A* route planner running on OpenStreetMap in C++, similar to what is used on professional router planners like Google Maps. 

It can calculate and draw the shortest path from point a to point b. The user enters two coordinates with x and y between 0 and 100, then the map is drawn using the io2d library and the shortest path is rendered in blue.The distance between the two points is printed out in the console in meters afterwards.
